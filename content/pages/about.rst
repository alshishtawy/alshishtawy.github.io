Projects
========
- **AnaRISE:** Big Data Analytics for Visualization of RISE Business, Internal RISE Project, 2020 - 2021.

  Internal RISE digitalization project with a goal to make available, for employees and managers, a set of rich information and visualization tools for exploring the various activities, projects, people, and groups across RISE. The project is based on data driven analytics and NLP and uses automated ML pipelines to easily incorporate new data.}


- Streamline_: Fast Reactive Analytics, EU funded ICT-16-2015 Big Bata research, 2015 - 2018.

  The goal of STREAMLINE is delivery of fast reactive analytics to be useful for a broad spectrum of problems including personalized recommendation, customer retention and of the targeted services. The approach to apply includes developing a high level declarative language for reducing the programming expertise of users and developing fast reactive machine learning technologies.

- **ROSE**: **R**\ oll **O**\ ut **S**\ cenarios of **E**\ lectric Roads, 2018 - 2019.

  The goal of the project is to identify road segments that are most suitable and economically viable to be converted to electric roads and to have a gradual roll out plan for electric roads on large Europe-scale network. In this project, we adopt a data driven approach to identify suitable road segments and propose roll out plan by analysing and fusing various traffic datasets to analyse driving pattern of individual vehicles. The vehicle positioning data available at Scania and Volvo provides information about driving pattern and fuel consumption and can thereby be analyzed  to identify suitable stretches. The project is a collaboration between RISE, Scania, Volvo Trucks, Chalmers University, and the Swedish Transport Agency.


- BIDAF_: Big Data Analytics Framework. Funded by KK-stiftelsen_, 2015 - 2020.

  The goal of the BIDAF project is to create a strong distributed research environment for Big Data Analytics. The scientific objectives centre around realising the promise of advanced, near real-time analytics on uncertain data with high volume and velocity through machine learning techniques, with key challenges including i) development of a computational platform suitable for machine learning of massive streaming and distributed data; ii) development of machine learning algorithms suitable for handling both opportunities and challenges with massive data; and iii) to provide analytics methodology and high level functionality to make the value in massive data easier to access.

- BADA_: FFI - Big Automotive Data Analytics. Funded by Vinnova_, 2015 - 2017.
  The BADA project fuses big data analytics with the transport industry in Sweden. It is a collaboration between RISE SICS, Volvo cars, Volvo trucks, Scania, and the Swedish Transport Agency. It is financed by Vinnova, a state funding agency. In the BADA project, we investigate how big data analytics platforms and machine learning algorithms can impact the transport and automotive industries. The approach is centred on a number of industry driven use-cases and the development of prototype systems.
