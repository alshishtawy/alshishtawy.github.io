I am a senior researcher at `RISE Research Institutes of Sweden`_. I work in the `Computer Systems Laboratory`_ (CSL) which was formerly part of the `Swedish Institute of Computer Science`_ (SICS). I received my PhD from `KTH Royal Institute of Technology`_, Stockholm, Sweden, in November 2012.
Earlier, I completed my B.Sc. and M.Sc. at the `Faculty of Computer and Information Sciences`_ (FCIS), Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.


Research challenges that inspire me include applying multidisciplinary state-of-the-art research to solve high impact problems in industry and society. My research interests include:

- Scalable Machine Learning;
- Large-Scale Distributed Systems and Algorithms;
- Big Data Platforms and Streaming Analytics;
- Cloud/Edge-Computing;
- Elasticity and Autonomic Computing.
