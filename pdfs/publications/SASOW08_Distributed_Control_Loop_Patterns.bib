  abstract = {In this paper we discuss various control loop patterns for managing
	distributed applications with multiple control loops. We introduce
	a high-level framework, called DCMS, for developing, deploying and
	managing component-based distributed applications in dynamic environments.
	The control loops, and interactions among them, are illustrated in
	the context of a distributed self-managing storage service implemented
	using DCMS to achieve various self-* properties. Different control
	loops are used for different self-* behaviours, which illustrates
	one way to divide application management, which makes for both ease
	of development and for better scalability and robustness when managers
	are distributed. As the multiple control loops are not completely
	independent, we demonstrate different patterns to deal with the interaction
	and potential conflict between multiple managers.},
