  abstract = {Currently, increasing costs and escalating complexities are primary
	issues in the distributed system management. The policy based management
	is introduced to simplify the management and reduce the overhead,
	by setting up policies to govern system behaviors. Policies are sets
	of rules that govern the system behaviors and reflect the business
	goals or system management objectives.
	
	This paper presents a generic policy-based management framework which
	has been integrated into an existing distributed component management
	system, called Niche, that enables and supports self-management.
	In this framework, programmers can set up more than one Policy-Manager-Group
	to avoid centralized policy decision making which could become a
	performance bottleneck. Furthermore, the size of a Policy-Manager-Group,
	i.e. the number of Policy-Managers in the group, depends on their
	load, i.e. the number of requests per time unit. In order to achieve
	good load balancing, a policy request is delivered to one of the
	policy managers in the group randomly chosen on the fly. A prototype
	of the framework is presented and two generic policy languages (policy
	engines and corresponding APIs), namely SPL and XACML, are evaluated
	using a self-managing file storage application as a case study.},
