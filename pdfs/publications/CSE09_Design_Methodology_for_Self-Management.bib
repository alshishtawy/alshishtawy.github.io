  abstract = {Autonomic computing is a paradigm that aims at reducing administrative
	overhead by providing autonomic managers to make applications self-managing.In
	order to better deal with dynamic environments, for improved performance
	andscalability, we advocate for distribution of management functions
	among several cooperative managers that coordinate their activities
	in order to achieve management objectives. We present a methodology
	for designing the management part of a distributed self-managing
	application in a distributed manner. We define design steps, that
	includes partitioning of management functions and orchestration of
	multiple autonomic managers. We illustrate the proposed design methodology
	by applying it to design and development of a distributed storage
	service as a case study. The storage service prototype has been developed
	using the distributing component management system \emph{Niche}.
	Distribution of autonomicmanagers allows distributing the management
	overhead and increased management performance due to concurrency
	and better locality.},
